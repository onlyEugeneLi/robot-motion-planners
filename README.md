# 2D Space Robot Path Planning Algorithms Performance Analysis
Consider a mobile robot in a 2D environment. Our objective is to find a path between a start
position and a goal position. The robot is initially located at the start position, and it is expected
move to the goal position, without colliding with any obstacles in the environment. 

The main dependencies are Python packages **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.

### Randomised Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)

Randomized Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) is a motion planning algorithm commonly used in robotics and computer graphics to efficiently search high-dimensional spaces. It was introduced by Steven M. LaValle in 1998. RRT is particularly well-suited for problems involving robotic motion planning, where a robot needs to navigate from a start configuration to a goal configuration in a complex environment.

### Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)

Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) is a motion planning algorithm designed for robot path planning in complex and high-dimensional configuration spaces. Developed to address challenges in real-world robotics applications, PRM was introduced by Lydia E. Kavraki, Petr Svestka, Jean-Claude Latombe, and Mark H. Overmars in 1996. The algorithm constructs a roadmap, a graph representation of the configuration space, by randomly sampling valid configurations and connecting them through collision-free paths. PRM employs a probabilistic approach, allowing for efficient exploration and representation of the environment's geometry. It has proven effective in solving motion planning problems for robots operating in environments with obstacles, providing a versatile solution for practical applications in robotics and automation.

### A-star (A*) algorithms

The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm commonly used in graph traversal and search problems, particularly in robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer games. Developed by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael in 1968, A* is an informed search algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a graph. It combines the advantages of both Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search by using a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal. A* maintains a priority queue, called the open set, to iteratively explore the nodes with the lowest estimated total cost. The algorithm's efficiency is enhanced by the use of a heuristic function, which guides the search towards the goal while considering the cost of the path traveled. A* is widely employed in robotics, gaming, and various artificial intelligence applications where efficient and optimal pathfinding is crucial.
